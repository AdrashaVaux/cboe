This branch contains just the history of the Win32 folder from the original repo, for legacy reference.
It is kept around mainly because it may contain bits of code that could be imported into the main repository.

There is no guarantee that the contents of this branch is alone sufficient to compile this old version of the
program - in particular, files from rsrc/ in the main repo may also be needed.
