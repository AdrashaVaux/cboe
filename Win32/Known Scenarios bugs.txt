- Bandits II : Ballad of the Red Star

	In the final fight (with the Ultimate Weapon), the "Unfortunately you die ..." (and "Again", and "Again", ...) can be wrongly triggered
	when the last pink form dies because an Eliminate Monster node is wrongly used between the two forms (pink -> blue) transition (then the blue form can takes its slot and
	wrongly triggering its on_death node).

	Workarounds :
		- Refrain from summoning (and pray that Disco Joe keeps on tossing Firestorms and Divine Thuds)
		- Kill the two and third forms in the same round (i've seen NPC do that, especially when hasted  )
		- Have some NPC killed 
		- Open the scenario in the Scenario Editor, go to town 28 and change the town special 54 to No Special (or whatever that does nothing), save and redo the encounter (if you're already in the Nuclear Bomb town, that you won't work).
		- Persist on trying, one moment or another the free slot won't be 10 (the thing is not to summon anything after the second pink is dead. Note that if Disco Joe cast Major Haste, then it will likely be ok, given that Bladesman Wasazore will have 24 AP that is often enough to single-hand two pink forms).
	
- Fog :

		The final boss life flag is also used in the "One-Time text message" right before opening the box hidden in the bat cave. That can lead to problem if the Activate Encounter function is changed in the future (for example, checking if the flag is > 0 instead of == 1).
		
		Workarounds :
			- Do nothing, for now there should be no trouble.
			- To be sure, open up the Scenario Editor and change the SDF of the node right before the box to [4][2] (instead of [14][2]) as it was intended to be (see other SDF).
	
	
-Pyramids :

	Water elementals and scorpions graphics are displaying large portion of white. That happens because the color used for those graphics' background is not pure white (generally : 255,255,255).
	
	Workaround : Manually paint the background with pure white in the scenario graphic sheet.
