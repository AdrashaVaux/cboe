Changes :

- Changed the description of Affect Webs node spec1b so that it states that 0 was inflict and 1 cure.
- Changed the description of Town Special Encounter spec1a so that it states to choose between 1 and 10.
- Changed the Event preventing the Town from dying to accept (and states to choose) values between 1 and 10.
- Animated terrains now play animations.
- Custom terrains now displays (and animated terrains plays)
- Custom items and monsters now display.
- Boats and horses now displays on the view when editing towns.

Beta 2 :

- Dumping functions won't change current town/outdoor section anymore.
- Finished porting the file IO functions to 32 bits.
- Added a rudimentary custom intro picture behavior : if the intro picture is set to 100, the first icon on the custom sheet will be displayed in the scenario selection menu. Scenario intro pics must be drawn on the same scale as talk icons.
- Whenever the “Place Random Items” function is used, the editor will inform the user that it could not place all items because the town item # limit has been reached, regardless of how many items are actually in the town. That has been fixed (the message now displays only if the max number of items is indeed reached).
- Cleaned the ressource file (smaller executable).
- Added a Monster data dumping function (dumps all info about monsters : wandering/special enc/town monsters details ...)
- Added a Specials data dumping function (dumps all info about specials : number, types, variables, ...)
- Town Room/Outdoors Info rectangles are now initialized at ((-1,-1),(-1,-1)) freeing the 0 coordinate and fixing the "Rectangle X" description at (0,0) in the game.
- Cleanse Rectangle SDF1 info rewritten to match actual behavior (0 leave force/fire/webs/crate/barrel, 1 cleans all).
- Corrected the Do SFX Burst info text (1 - telep., 2 - elec.)
- When placing an item with a custom graphic in a town, the editor will display the graphic in the upper-left corner of the space it is placed on. Fixed.
- If you edit a monster’s abilities and click Cancel, the ability of that monster will be removed. Fixed.
- If you edit a item's ability, all previously unsaved modifications are erased. Fixed.
- Disappearences of right scroll bar fixed.

Version 1.0 :

- Added a switch to the Scenario Details to bypass the automatic difficulty adjust
- Added the ability to play sound asynchronously (use -sound_number instead of sound_number).
- If a custom monster pic was shown in the monster dialog and a non-custom monster was loaded via the arrows, the pic was always drawn from the custom sheet. Fixed.
- Cancelling while choosing an item ability won't reset the item ability to "No ability" anymore.
- Added a "Change Town Lightning" node. (StarEye a.k.a *i)
- Loading a town in the main menu won't get into editing mode automatically anymore.
- Added an option in the Town Advanced details to prevent the mapping (like in older Exiles).
- Added a "Display picture" node, that living up to its name, displays a picture. Bitmaps (BMP) are the only supported format but image can be of any size
(be warned that if the image is larger/wider than the screen, it will be streched to fit, meaning a (potentially substancial) loss of quality).
The name of the file is search in the scenario special strings (160 to 259) as specified in the node ex1a field. The format must be "[eventual path]filename.bmp".
The base search folder is "[folder_the_scenario_is_in]/scenario_name.exr/".
- Corrected the "Type Flag" description text (is between 0 and 255).
- Modified the "Has Enough Mage Lore?" node into a general statistic check node. (StarEye a.k.a *i)
Here is a description of fields :

ex1a: how much of skill
ex1b: special to call if enough
ex2a: skill index (-1 defaults to mage lore to preserve compatibility) 
0 - 18 corresponding skill,
19 - Current Health,
20 - Max Health,
21 - Current Spell Points,
22 - Max Spell Points,
23 - Experience,
24 - Skill points,
25 - Level.

ex2b: 0, others - cumulative, 1 - highest, 2 - average, 3 - lowest, 10 + x - that PC. (-1 defaults to mage lore to preserve compatibility)
- Added a "Has enough species ?" node, which checks if the party has (at least) a specified number of character with a given race. (StarEye a.k.a *i)
- Modified the "Give ... spells" nodes to either take (spec.1b = 0) or give (spec.1b = 1) spells and have access to low level spells (spec.1a = 100 + spell_number, with 0 <= spell_number <= 29 ) (StarEye a.k.a *i)
- Added an option in Town Advanced Details to prevent Magic Mapping from being cast (already included in the Map Unavailable option).
- Added an option in Town Advanced Details that specifies a town special to call if the town becomes hostile (for compatibility reasons the special 0 can't be called in legacy scenarios).
- Added a "Change Creature Attitude" node in Town specs : spec.ex1a is the number of the monster in the current town and ex.1b is the attitude to set it to (0 - Friendly, Docile, 1 - Hostile, Type A, 2 - Friendly, Will fight, 3 - Hostile, Type B).
- Modified the "Make town hostile" node to "Set Town Attitude". Spec.ex1a is 0 for hostile, 1 for friendly. The dead part (2) is currently non functionnal.

ToDo :

- Make an option to disable the editor's automatic placement of terrains. This includes the conforming of cave wall, mountains, water, hills; placing hills around mountains; placing the second half of the 2-space rubbles.
-Inverted/Skewed Values — many things in the BOE editor have the wrong value to start off with. Crystal Wand and Prismatic Wand are inverted. Many monsters are this way as well — One of the Unicorns begins the game as reptile. (Thanks to ‘A Short Term Effect’ for pointing this one out.)
If you change these values in Bladbase.exs, they will remain changed in any new scenarios you create, saving you the trouble of fixing these in every new scenario you create.

First, I was reading a section under the BOE FAQ, and it mentioned something
along the lines of a lock-picking sword. Which would presumably be a weapon
with the special ability "lockpick." They mentioned the trick of changing the
item's type from Tool (the item type of the lockpicks already included in the
default items list) to something else. But I'm afraid that this is the only
way that I seem to be able to create the standard type of lockpicks as a new
item. When I click on the "reagents" button, it tells me that an item of that
type (tool) cannot be given an ability of that sort because it can be
equipped. But only equipped lockpicks are usable by the player character,
right? What I have to do is to select an item type of "non-use item" for
example, set the ability to "lockpick" and then change the item type back to
"Tool" without opening the "item special abilities" menu, since the editor
seems to automatically clear any item ability that doesn't seem to belong for
a certain item type.

3) If the kill/raise dead special is called during combat mode, and the
special brings a dead member back to life, strange things will happen.

*4) To enhance a steel wave blade with the flaming weapon ability, it will
cost 10000 gold, but with the steel halberd (Which is worth a lot more) it
only costs 1500 gold! steel halberd => flaming : 28139, +1 : 13813
					  steel great sword => flaming : 28093, +1 : 13409
					  steel great mace => flaming : 28069, +1 : 13206

12) If you have two items with the same ability equiped, it seems that it
will give your character the lower ability strength of the two.

13) When you creat a new scenario, it will ask you to name it. What ever
you type in for Scenario Name seems to not do anything.

14) If you have the special node, Call Global Special, and you have already
set which global special to call as a number over 99, and press the
Creat/Edit button, instead of taking you to the number that you typed in,
it will creat a new special.

15) Here's a strange bug that I don't quite know how to explain: Lets say
you are in town #x, and you step on a stairway special that is on the
coordinants a,b and the town that the special takes you to is less than x,
and the coordinants that it takes you to are something other than a,b and
there is a special in the new town on the coordinates a,b then the game
will call the special that is on coordinates a,b in the new town. (And no,
I did not set the advanced settings to call any special when that town is
entered) I know I worded that a little strange, if you need me explain it
better, please let me know.

16) Here's a good way to cheat, use the mage spell Simalcrum and capture a
basilisk, then you can summon it and have it kill a boss enemy. I did this
in A Small Rebelion and killed Stalker without even having to get near him.

20) On faster computers, it is hard to see the animation on animated terrains.

21) If you use a custom graphic for an item, it doesn't seem to center it
properly.

23) At high levels, casting the bless spell once will make your character
impossible to be hit by physical attacks.

24) Using the refresh jobs/shops debug option while shoping in one of the
Magic Shops will produce strange results. Also there are no jobs, so
souldn't it be called just refresh shops instead of refresh jobs/shops?
