However, you need to have Resurrection Balm for the spell to work, and there is a small chance (decreasing with your level) that it turns the corpse to dust.

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Level 6:</span></p>
<p class="p4">Heal All: (C 8) <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like the Heal spell, but affects the whole party. Very efficient.</p>
<p class="p4">Revive:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(C 7)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This heals all damage and cures all poison for a PC.</p>
<p class="p4">Hyperactivity: (C 8) <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This spell wakes up all PCs, and provides a small amount of magical protection from sleeping.</p>
<p class="p4">Destone: (C 8) <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Certain rare monsters can turn one of your characters to stone. This valuable spell undoes the damage.</p>

<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Level 7:</span></p>
<p class="p4">Revive All: (C 10) <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When cast, the party receives a powerful healing (increasing with level of the caster) and has poison cured as well.</p>
<p class="p4">Ravage Spirit:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(C 10, R 4) Demons have a nasty tendency to resist any<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>spells you throw at them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This spell gives them a blow which, most of the time, does a lot of damage. The chance of success increases with the level of the caster.</p>
<p class="p4">Resurrect:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(C 35)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like raise dead, but much more effective, and works on even a dusted character. It still requires Resurrection Balm to cast.</p>
<p class="p4">Divine Thud:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(C 10, R 12)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The most powerful offensive priest spell. It delivers a stunning blow of force to all beings within two spaces of the targeted space.</p>

<p class="p4">Word of Recall:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(C 30) This spell returns the party to the town where you began the scenario. Because of the danger of teleporting from narrow, windy tunnels, it can only be cast outdoors.</p>
