<h1>The Blades of Exile Menus</h1>
<p>Blades of Exile’s menus can perform many of the actions in the game, and dispense help and information as well.</p>
<h2>File Menu</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Open</dt>
<dd>Selecting this has you load in one of your older games. You can do this anytime.</dd>
<dt>Save, Save As</dt>
<dd>This option has Blades of Exile take a "snapshot" of your current position in the game, so you can resume from this point later, should you mess up. Blades of Exile will prompt you for the name of your save file. You can only save the game in town or outdoors. Making several back-up save files is recommended.</dd>
<dt>New Game</dt>
<dd>Should you get fed up, you can start over again.</dd>
<dt>Preferences</dt>
<dd>This option brings up the preferences dialog. This is described below.</dd>
<dt>Quit</dt>
<dd>When you’ve just plain had enough.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>The Preferences Window</h2>
<p>From here, you can change how the game plays.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Display Alignment</dt>
<dd>This option determines how the Blades of Exile window is drawn on the screen. You can have the game take up the full screen, with the game information drawn in a corner you choose, or you can play Blades of Exile in a window you can drag around the screen.</dd>
<dt>Game Speed (Fast/Medium/Slow)</dt>
<dd>This option reduces or increases the speed at which things take place.</dd>
<dt>No graphics frills</dt>
<dd>When turned on, most of Blades of Exile’s animation and graphics tricks disappears, resulting in a dramatic increase in game speed.</dd>
<dt>Turn off terrain animation</dt>
<dd>When on, Blades of Exile’s terrain will not be animated, making the game go faster.</dd>
<dt>Turn off frills on shore</dt>
<dd>When on, the frilly edge at the edge of pits, water, and lava won’t be drawn, making the game go faster.</p>
<dt>Don’t Save Maps</dt>
<dd>Normally, the game stores maps you’ve found in your save files. This makes the save files 60K larger. Selecting this option keeps Blades of Exile from saving your maps, resulting in smaller save files.</dd>
<dt>No Sounds</dt>
<dd>This option turns off the game’s sounds.</dd>
<dt>Show Room Descriptions More Than Once</dt>
<dd>Often, you will find a special encounter which shows a description of what you’ve just found. Once found, most of these won’t be printed again. This option makes the messages kept around to be printed whenever you encounter them.</dd>
<dt>Never Show Instant Help</dt>
<dd>When selected, the Instant Help windows will never appear.</dd>
<dt>Reset Instant Help</dt>
<dd>Click on this to make all Instant Help windows appear again.</dd>
<dt>Make Game Easier</dt>
<dd>When on, monsters will have fewer health points, and do less damage.</dd>
<dt>Fewer Wandering Monsters</dt>
<dd>When on, fewer monsters will randomly appear outdoors and in towns.</dd>
<dt>No Targeting Line (Windows Only)</dt>
<dd>If experiencing crashes when targeting a missile or spell, you may have problems with your display driver. Turn this on to remove the problem.</dd>
<dt>Fewer Sounds (Windows Only)</dt>
<dd>If you have an older sound card (or sound card driver), some sound effects may cause crashes. Turn this on to remove the problem.</dd>
</dl>
