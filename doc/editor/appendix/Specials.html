<p class="p1"><b>Section 14: Appendix 1 - Special Encounter Node Types</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>These are the many types of special encounter nodes. They are divided into six different categories, and given with examples and descriptions of what the various editing fields do.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>General Use Specials</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>This is the class of special encounters which can be called at practically any time. Most of them can always be called. A few cant - these are noted in the encounter description.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b>General notes:</b></p>
<p class="p3"><b>Stuff done 1, Stuff done 2:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b> Some of these nodes change a Stuff Done flag. A Stuff Done flag is described by two values: Stuff done 1 and Stuff done 2. The legal range of the first flag is from 0 to 299, and the range for the second flag is 0 to 9. If a value is given outside the legal range, the special node does nothing and the Jump To node is called next (though often the editor will give you an error when you try to do this).</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Jump To:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b> After a special node is called and has its effect, this field specifies the next node to be called. If this value is negative, the special encounter ends.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The exceptions to this are the nodes that stop the special encounter (e.g. Town Block, Out Block). When a node stops the encounter, the Jump To flag is ignored.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Type 0: No special<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is the default setting for all special nodes. It does nothing. If the Jump To field contains a non-negative number, the encounter jumps to that node.</p>
<p class="p3">Uses: If you have a chain of special nodes and want to remove one of the nodes in the middle, set its type to Null Special, and leave the Jump To value unchanged. When the party reaches that special, and that node is reached, it just passes through to the Jump To node.</p>
<p class="p3">Type 1: Set Flag<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This node sets a Stuff Done flag to the desired value.</p>
<p class="p3">Mess1, Mess2: Standard usage.</p>
<p class="p3">Stuff done 1, Stuff done 2: This is the Stuff Done flag to change.</p>
<p class="p3">Extra 1a: This is the value to change it to.</p>
<p class="p3">Example:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If Stuff done 1 is set to 90, Stuff done 2 is set to 4, and Extra 1a is set to 8, when this node is called Stuff Done (90,4) becomes 8. If, instead, Stuff done 2 is set to 40, this value is out of range (0 ... 9) and you will get an error.</p>
<p class="p3">Type 2: Increment Flag<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This node increases (or decreases) a Stuff Done flag by a specified amount.</p>
<p class="p3">Mess1, Mess2: Standard usage.</p>
<p class="p3">Stuff done 1, Stuff done 2: This is the Stuff Done flag to change.</p>
<p class="p3">Extra 1a: This is the amount to increase/decrease the flag by.</p>
<p class="p3">Extra 1b: If this is 0, the flag is increased by Extra 1a. If its non-zero, the flag is decreased by that amount.</p>
<p class="p3">Type 3: Display Message<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This vitally important special displays a dialog window containing one (or two) text messages.</p>
<p class="p3">Mess1, Mess2: Standard usage.</p>
<p class="p3">Type 4: Secret Passage<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This unusual special encounter only has an effect when its called when the party steps on it, and its the first encounter in the chain. Then, the party can walk through that space as it its a secret passage.</p>
<p class="p3">Uses: Suppose you want a pillar the party can walk through. Place a special encounter on the pillar, and have a node of this type be the first special node called.</p>
<p class="p3">Type 5: Display Small Message<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A text message is displayed on one (or two) line(s) of the text area (in the lower right hand corner). Dont make the displayed messages too long.</p>
<p class="p3">Mess1, Mess2: Standard usage - these are the numbers of the messages to put in one or two lines of the text area.</p>
<p class="p3">Type 6: Flip Flag<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This node changes a Stuff Done flag from 0 to 1 (or back).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Mess1, Mess2: Standard usage.</p>
<p class="p3">Stuff done 1, Stuff done 2: This is the Stuff Done flag to change. If the flag is 0, its changed to 1. Otherwise, its changed to 0.</p>
<p class="p3">Type 7: Out Block<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the party is currently outdoors, this node ends the special encounter and nothing else happens. Otherwise, the Jump To node is called.</p>
<p class="p3">Mess1, Mess2: Standard usage.</p>
<p class="p3">Extra 1a: This starts as 0. If this is 1, and the party is outdoors and walking, they are not allowed to enter the space.</p>
<p class="p3">Type 8: Town block<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like Out Block, but ends the special if the party is in town.</p>
<p class="p3">Mess1, Mess2: Standard usage.</p>
<p class="p3">Extra 1a: This starts as 0. If this is 1, and the party is in town and walking, they are not allowed to enter the space.</p>
<p class="p3">Type 9: Combat block<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like Out Block, but ends the special if the party is in combat.</p>
<p class="p3">Mess1, Mess2: Standard usage.</p>
<p class="p3">Extra 1a: This starts as 0. If this is 1, and the party is in combat and walking, they are not allowed to enter the space.</p>
<p class="p3">Type 10: Looking block<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like Out Block, but ends the special if this node was called by the party looking at something.</p>
<p class="p3">Uses:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Suppose you place a special on a closed portcullis, to be called when the portcullis is opened and the party walks through it. Normally, if the party looks at the closed portcullis, the special you intended to be triggered when they walked on it will be called. Placing a Looking Block before that special will keep it from being called before they actually walk on it.</p>
<p class="p3">Type 11: Cant Enter<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the party is walking, they are not allowed to enter the space. This can be accompanied by one or two messages, if you wish.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Mess1, Mess2: Standard usage. If the party is not moving, no messages are displayed.</p>
<p class="p3">Extra 1a:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If this is set to 1, the party is kept from entering the space. If not 1, the party is allowed to enter the space (this undoes any Cant Enter nodes already called).</p>
<p class="p3">Uses:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you dont want a party to be able to walk down a passage (for example, a guard wont let them), use this node.</p>
<p class="p3">Note: This doesnt have to be the last node in a chain. If this is the first special node called, the party is still kept from entering the space.</p>
<p class="p3">Type 12: Change Time<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This special node sets the adventure time forward.</p>
<p class="p3">Extra 1a: This is the number of ticks to set the timer forward. A day is 3000 ticks. The maximum this can be set to is 30000.</p>
<p class="p3">Type 13: Start General Timer<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One of the parties special encounter timers is activated. Each move taken, the timer goes down by 1. When it runs out, a scenario special node is called (even if the party enters or leaves town). Also see Start Town Timer, under Town Special Nodes.</p>
<p class="p3">Extra 1a: The number of moves before the timer runs out. (Range 0 ... 30000)</p>
<p class="p3">Extra 1b: The scenario special node to call when the timer runs out. If left at No Special, nothing happens.</p>
<p class="p3">Type 14: Play a sound<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Plays one of the games sounds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Extra1a: Which sound to play. For a list of sounds, read Appendix A.</p>
<p class="p3">Type 15: Change Horse Possession<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Makes a horse the parties property (or not).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Mess1, Mess2: Standard usage.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Extra1a: The horse to change ownership of. (Range 0 ... 29)</p>
<p class="p3">Extra 2a: If 0, the horse becomes the parties property. Otherwise, it is no longer the parties property.</p>
<p class="p3">Type 16: Change Boat Possession<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like Change Horse Possession, except for boats.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Mess1, Mess2: Standard usage.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Extra1a: The boat to change ownership of. (Range 0 ... 29)</p>
<p class="p3">Extra 2a: If 0, the boat becomes the parties property. Otherwise, it is no longer the parties property.</p>
<p class="p3">Type 17: Show/Hide Town<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This either makes a party know a town is there, or hide it so they cant enter it anymore. This can be accompanied by one or two messages, if you wish.</p>
<p class="p3">Mess1, Mess2: Standard usage.</p>
<p class="p3">Extra1a: This is the town to show/hide.</p>
<p class="p3">Extra 1b: If 0, the town becomes hidden. If not 0, the town becomes visible.</p>
<p class="p3">Uses:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Suppose dungeon 14 contains a big treasure, revealed by reading a treasure map. When the map is read, call this special. Set Extra 1a to 14 and Extra 2b to 1.</p>
<p class="p3">Type 18: Major Event Has Occurred<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A major event is recorded as having occurred. See Passage of Time in the chapter on Special Encounters for a more detailed explanation.</p>
<p class="p3">Mess1, Mess2: Standard usage.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Extra 1a: The number of the special event. (Range 1 ... 20)</p>
<p class="p3">Example: If the slaying of the goblin king is event 4, when it is killed, call this special node with Extra 1a set to 4.</p>
<p class="p3">Type 19: Forced Give<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This places an item in the parties inventory, whether or not its too heavy for them to carry. It only fails to give the item if there is absolutely no room in their inventory.</p>
<p class="p3">Mess1, Mess2: Standard usage.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Extra 1a: The number of the item to give. Press the Choose button to pick an item.</p>
<p class="p3">Extra 2b: The special to jump to if the item is not successfully given (if all the parties item slots are full). If No Special is given, the Jump To special is used as usual.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Uses: If you want the party to get an item after winning a combat outdoors, use a Forced Give. This makes sure that if it is at all possible, they get it.</p>
<p class="p3">Uses 2: Use this is the party is given an item during a talking special encounter. If the party inventory is full, jump to a special telling them that they cant carry the item and to come back later, and then end the special. This enables you to keep from setting a Stuff Done flag saying they got the item, when, in fact, they didnt.</p>
<p class="p3">Type 20: Buy Items of Type All items that belong to the given special class (described in the chapter on items) are taken from the party. For each item taken, the party gets some gold. This can be accompanied by one or two messages, if you wish.</p>
<p class="p3">Mess1, Mess2: Standard usage. Note that the messages are only displayed if some items are actually taken away.</p>
<p class="p3">Extra 1a: The item class to take away. (Range 1 ... 100)</p>
<p class="p3">Extra 1b: The special to jump to if no items are taken. If No Special is specified, the Jump To special is used as usual.</p>
<p class="p3">Extra 2a: The amount of gold to pay for each item (Range 0 ... 250)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Uses:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is a how you give a bounty for items. If you want someone to give the party 10 gold for each unicorn horn, give unicorn horns a special class of, say, 30, and call this special node with Extra 1a set to 30 and Extra 2a set to 10.</p>
<p class="p3">Type 21: Call Global Special<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This node does nothing itself. However, its Jump To node specifies a scenario special node, not a town or outdoors special node. This is how you call a scenario special node when in town or outdoors.</p>
<p class="p3">Note: Use when in town or outdoors. This can be used if you have one special thing which you want in many towns or outdoors sections. You can place the encounter in scenario specials once, and then just call it from the many places its used.</p>
<p class="p3">Type 22: Set Many Flags <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This node sets 10 Stuff Done flags to a desired value. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Stuff Done 1: A number from 0 to 299. When this node is called, (Stuff Done 1, 0), (Stuff Done 1, 1), ... (Stuff Done 1, 9) are all set to Extra 1a.</p>
<p class="p3">Extra 1a: This is the value to change it to.</p>
<p class="p3">Example: Suppose Stuff Done flag (200,4) is 35. This node is called with Stuff Done 1 equal to 200, and Extra 1a set to 5. Then Stuff Done flag (200,4) will be 5 (as will flags (200,0), (200,1), etc.).</p>
<p class="p3">Type 23: Copy Flag<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This sets one Stuff Done flag equal to another.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Stuff Done 1, Stuff Done 2: The flag to change.</p>
<p class="p3">Extra 1a, Extra 1b: The flag to change it to.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Example: If Stuff Done 1 is 12, Stuff Done 2 is 5, Extra 1a is 8, and Extra 1b is 8, then the value of Stuff Done flag (12,5) becomes the same as Stuff Done flag (8,8).</p>
<p class="p3">Type 24: Ritual of Sanct. Block<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When the party casts Ritual of Sanctification on a space, any special encounter on that space is called. If the first node called is of this type, the special encounter in Jump To is called, and the special encounter continues. Otherwise, the special encounter ends immediately, and the player is told that the ritual had no effect.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>If this special node is called for a reason besides the party casting Ritual of Sanctification (for example, if they searched the space), the special node in Extra 1b is called.</p>
<p class="p3">Extra 1b: The special node called if this node is called for any reason other than the party casting Ritual of Sanctification.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Type 25: Have a rest<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the party is in combat or if the party is in town and there was just combat going on, nothing happens. Otherwise, the party gets rested. Some time passes, and their health and spell points are restored.</p>
<p class="p3">Extra 1a: The number of ticks that pass (a day is 3000 ticks)</p>
<p class="p3">Extra 1b: The amount of health and spell points to restore.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Type 26: Wandering Will Fight<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This special node only has an effect if called when the party has just encountered a group of monsters outdoors. If called at any other time, it has no effect. The node determines whether the monsters in the group will actually attack the party or not.</p>
<p class="p3">Extra 1a: If this is set to 0, the monsters will not attack the party, and the outdoor encounter will simply end. If its non-zero, the monsters will attack the party.</p>
<p class="p3">Uses: Suppose a group of soldiers outdoors will only attack the party if they have the stolen Wand of Balloo. If they don't have it, use this node with Extra 1a set to 0. If you dont call a special node of this type, the soldiers will attack.</p>
<p class="p3">Type 27: End Scenario<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Every scenario should call a node of this type at least once. When called, the scenario immediately ends, and the player will be returned to the starting screen, with the option of saving the game.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Note: Without a node of this sort, the players only option for leaving the scenario is to use the character editor. Please make sure a node of this sort can always be reached.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>One-Shot Specials</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>This is the class of specials you generally only want to occur one time, such as giving items.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>For each of these special node types, you can specify a Stuff Done flag in the Stuff Done 1 and Stuff Done 2 fields. If you do, when the node is called, if that flag has a value of 250, the node does nothing and the special ends immediately. If the flag is not 250, the node has the desired effect, and then that Stuff Done flag is set to 250 (so this node has no effect is called again).</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>These nodes have one more special property. If you have a have a special encounter marked by a white dot, the first node called from that special encounter is a One-Shot Special, and the specified Stuff Done flag in that node is 250, then the white dot disappears. Thus, specials that dont do anything anymore arent marked by a special dot.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b>General notes:</b></p>
<p class="p3"><b>Stuff done 1, Stuff done 2:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b> All of these nodes change a Stuff Done flag. A Stuff Done flag is described by two values: Stuff done 1 and Stuff done 2. The legal range of the first flag is from 0 to 299, and the range for the second flag is 0 to 9. You can give a value outside the legal range (such as -1 for Stuff Done 1). If you do this, the special node does its job normally, and if this node is called again, it will do it again. This is sometimes a good idea.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Jump To:</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>This works as before, with one exception. If the specified Stuff Done flag for the called node is 250, the special encounter ends and the Jump To field is ignored.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Type 50: Give Item<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An item is given to the party (specifically, to the first character who can carry it). Gold and food can also be given. If the party cannot carry another item, the Stuff Done flag is not set to 250. This can be accompanied by one or two messages, if you wish.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Stuff done 1, Stuff done 2: As usual.</p>
<p class="p3">Mess1, Mess2: Standard usage. If the items cannot be taken, no messages are displayed.</p>
<p class="p3">Extra 1a: The number of the item to be given. If -1, no item is given. Press the Choose button to select an item.</p>
<p class="p3">Extra 1b: The amount of gold to give. (Range 0 ... 25000)</p>
<p class="p3">Extra 2a: The amount of food to give. (Range 0 ... 25000)</p>
<p class="p3">Extra 2b: The special to jump to if the item cannot be given (to, perhaps, tell them their inventory is full). If No Special is given, the Jump To special is called normally.</p>
<p class="p3">Type 51: Give Special Item<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Gives the party one of the scenarios special items. This can be accompanied by one or two messages, if you wish.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Stuff done 1, Stuff done 2: As usual.</p>
<p class="p3">Mess1, Mess2: Standard usage.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Extra 1a:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The number of the special item to give. (Range 0 ... 49)</p>
<p class="p3">Extra 1b:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If 0 (the default), the special item is given. Otherwise, its taken away.</p>
<p class="p3">Type 52: One-Time Do Nothing<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the Stuff Done flag is set to 250, this node ends the special encounter. Otherwise, it just calls the Jump To node.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Stuff done 1, Stuff done 2: As usual.</p>
<p class="p3">Uses:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is provided for one time encounters that dont fit into any of the other types. Some other special node must set the Stuff Done flag to 250 to get the encounter to disappear.</p>
<p class="p3">Type 53: One-Time Nothing and Set<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the Stuff Done flag is set to 250, this node ends the special encounter. Otherwise, it sets the Stuff Done flag to 250 and calls the Jump To node.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Stuff done 1, Stuff done 2: As usual</p>
<p class="p3">Type 54: One-Time Text Message<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Displays one or two message strings.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Stuff done 1, Stuff done 2: As usual.</p>
<p class="p3">Mess1, Mess2: Standard usage.</p>
<p class="p3">Type 55: Display Dialog (Dialog pic)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This very important special node displays a dialog box with up to six text messages and a dialog picture (which you choose) in the upper left. The lower right hand corner can have 1 to 3 buttons. The player must press a button, at which point another special node will be called. You choose a special node to call for each button.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The first button is always labeled OK if its the only button or Leave if there are other buttons. If the first button is pressed, the Jump To special is called normally. Otherwise the special node in Extra 1b or 2b is called.</p>
<p class="p3">Stuff done 1, Stuff done 2: As usual, with one exception. If the first button is pressed, the Stuff Done flag is not set to 250. Otherwise, it is.</p>
<p class="p3">Mess 1: The number of the first message to be displayed in the dialog box. The six messages starting with this message will be displayed in the dialog box (though the strings can, of course, be blank). Press the create/edit button to edit the text.</p>
<p class="p3">Mess 2: This determines whether the default OK/Leave button appears. If this is 1, this button appears. Otherwise, it doesnt.</p>
<p class="p3">Pict: This is the number of the picture to display. To select a picture, press the Choose button.</p>
<p class="p3">Extra 1a: Determines what the second button is labeled. If left -1, there is no second button. Press the Choose button to select a label.</p>
<p class="p3">Extra 1b: What special node to call is button 2 is pressed.</p>
<p class="p3">Extra 2a: Determines what the third button is labeled. If left -1, there is no third button. Press the Choose button to select a label.</p>
<p class="p3">Extra 2b: What special node to call is button 3 is pressed.</p>
<p class="p3">Example: If Mess 1 is 30, and Mess 2 is 4, the dialog box that comes up contains messages 30 through 33.</p>
<p class="p3">Note: A dialog box can only contain consecutive text messages. You cant bring up a dialog box which contains message 24, followed by messages 1, 20, and 64.</p>
<p class="p3">Example: Suppose to want a dialog box to come up displaying messages 37 through 40.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Uses: This is one special node where you may often want to leave Stuff Done 1 at -1 (so this node displays the dialog box every time its called). For example, if you want the text of a book to come up when the party looks at a certain bookshelf, you probably want the same text to keep coming up when the look at the bookshelf later on.</p>
<p class="p3">Type 56: Display Dialog (Terrain pic)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is exactly like Display Dialog (Dialog pic), except that the picture in the upper left is of a sort of terrain. Press the Select Picture button to pick the picture.</p>
<p class="p3">Type 57: Display Dialog (Monster pic)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is exactly like Display Dialog (Dialog pic), except that the picture in the upper left is of a monster. If you select a monster with size greater than 1 x 1, the dialog will show the complete picture of the monster. Press the Select Picture button to pick the picture.</p>
