<p class="p1"><b>Section 7 - Editing Monster Types</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Your default scenario comes with 187 premade monster types, number 1 to 187, and you can have 256 monster types overall. Like terrain types, you can customize the monster types to suit your scenario. Click on Edit Monster Types to bring up a list of creatures, and click on a monster type to bring up the monster editing window. This window has these options:</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b>Monster Name:</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The name of the creature.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Level:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b> Determines how much morale and skill the creature has. You should make this at least 1.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Health:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b> Number of health points.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Armor:</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The damage from each weapon blow is reduced by a random amount from 1 to this number.</p>

<p class="p3"><b>Attack Damage Number of Dice and Sides:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b> The amount of damage the monster does when it hits. For example, if a blow does eight dice of damage, each of which has 11 sides, the program generates 8 random numbers from 1 to 11, adds them up, and does that much damage.
